    <p>Hello! My name is Jacob Strong, I am 25 years-old, and I live in Portland, Oregon. I currently work as a service technician for one of the largest consumer technology companies in the world. In my role, I am responsible for troubleshooting and diagnosing hardware and software issues that users encounter with their devices. After a handful of years in this position, I have discovered that I have a passion for technology and I want to take my skills a step further by learning how to program!</p>

    <h2>Enter: Epicodus</h2>
    <p>As for <em>how</em> I am learning how to code, I am currently attending the part time C#/React program at Epicodus. In my first two weeks, I have begun to establish an understanding of the fundamentals of web development. Here is a short list of a few things I've learned so far!</p>

        <li>The first project that I would like to share is a webpage that I made about my cat, Nannah! Click <a href="https://jacobtstrong.github.io/nannah/">here</a> to check it out on GitHub Pages. This is a simple webpage made using HTML, CSS, and uploaded to GitHub Pages. The goal of this project was to practice the techniques that I learned in the first few days of the program.</li>
