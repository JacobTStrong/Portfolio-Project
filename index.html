    <h2>A brief introduction</h2>
    <img src="imgs/me.jpg" alt="me at a Halloween party" class="center">
    <p>Hello! My name is Jacob Strong, I am 25 years-old, and I live in Portland, Oregon. I currently work as a service technician for one of the largest consumer technology companies in the world. In my role, I am responsible for troubleshooting and diagnosing hardware and software issues that users encounter with their devices. After a handful of years in this position, I have discovered that I have a passion for technology and I want to take my skills a step further by learning how to program!</p>

    <h2>Enter: Epicodus</h2>
    <p>As for <em>how</em> I am learning how to code, I am currently attending the part time C#/React program at Epicodus. In my first two weeks, I have begun to establish an understanding of the fundamentals of web development. Here are three projects that I have made in my time at Epicodus so far! All of these projects were made using HTML and CSS, with README files made using Markdown</p>

    <div class="column">
      <ul>
        <li><p>The first project that I would like to share is a webpage that I made about my cat, Nannah! Click <a href="https://jacobtstrong.github.io/nannah/">here</a> to check it out on GitHub Pages. This was my first project utilizing GitHub Pages. The goal of this project was to practice the techniques that I learned in the first few days of the program.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="column">
      <ul>
        <li><p>Next let's take a look at another project I made for my program. This project is a simple resume excercise in divs and spans. I'll leave a link to the repository <a href="https://github.com/JacobTStrong/resume-website">here</a>.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="column">
      <ul>
        <li><p>Last but not least, lets take a look at the most recent project that I made. This one is a goofy mock website for one of my favorite restaurants! Check out the GitHub repository linked <a href=https://github.com/JacobTStrong/PDX-Sliders>here</a>.</p></li>

    <h2>More about me</h2>
    <p>Aside from fixing hardware at work and learning how to create software in class, I enjoy spending my free time playing my guitar, cooking, going on hikes, and playing video games! On top of all of that, I am a huge fan of movies! I'll list my (current) top 3 favorite movies with links to my favorite scenes from each!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The Cohen Brothers' <em>No Country For Old Men:</em></li>
      <p>- The famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opbi7d42s8E">coin toss</a> scene in No country for old men sees Javier Bardem's character eerily harassing a sweet old Texaco clerk. Perhaps my favorite scene in movie history.</p>
      <li>Robert Eggers' <em>The Lighthouse:</em></li>
      <p>- I can't help but feel like showing a scene for this movie won't do it any justice. I encourage you to watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyag7lR8CPA">trailer</a> instead. This film instantly became one of my favorites.</p>
      <li>James Mangold's <em>Ford v Ferrari:</em></li>
      <p>- Ford v Ferrari is one of the most intense movies that I have seen in a good while. The driving scenes in this movie are, dare I say, electric. Just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4gxjcQIKc0">watch</a>. If you havent seen it, you have to give it a shot.  </p>
