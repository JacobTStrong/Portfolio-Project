  <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio Project!</h1>
  <h2>A brief introduction.</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Jacob Strong, I am 25 years-old, and I live in Portland, Oregon. I currently work as a service technician for one of the largest consumer technology companies in the world. In my role, I am responsible for troubleshooting and diagnosing hardware and software issues that users encounter with their devices. After a handful of years in this position, I have discovered that I have a passion for technology and I want to take my skills a step further by learning how to program!</p>
  <h3>Enter: Epicodus</h3>
  <p>As for <em>how</em> I am learning how to code, I am currently attending the part time C#/React program at Epicodus. In my first two weeks, I have begun to establish an understanding of the fundamentals of web development. Here is a short list of a few things I've learned so far!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Here is a simple website about some of my favorite places!</li>
    <p>- The objective of this project was to practice the fundamentals of HTML and CSS</p>
    <li>Here is a webpage I made dedicated to my cat Nannah!</li>
    <p>- For this project, I wanted to create a webpage that I can send to people when they ask me if I have a pet!</p>
    <li>And here are a few small projects that were made during pair programming sessions in class!</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Floats</li>
        <p>- A simple webpage with a photo, sidebar, and wrapping text.</p>
        <li>Columns</li>
        <p>- A simple website showing paragraphs arranged in columns.</p>
        <li>READMEs</li>
        <p>- The very first README that I made!</p>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>I really enjoyed making a webpage for my cat in particular.</p>
  <h4>More about me</h4>
  <p>Aside from fixing hardware at work and learning how to create software in class, I enjoy spending my free time playing my guitar, cooking, going on hikes, and playing video games!</p>
  <p>On top of all of that, I am a huge fan of movies! I'll list my (current) top 3 favorite movies with links to my favorite scenes from each!</p>
